# Blink-Led-By-Ardunio
# Arduino Uno Circuit Project

Welcome to the Arduino Uno Circuit Project! This project is aimed at creating a circuit using the Arduino Uno microcontroller and simulating it online with the Tinkercad tool. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about electronics or an experienced Arduino enthusiast, this project provides an engaging and educational experience.


Introduction

In this project, we leverage the capabilities of the Arduino Uno, a versatile microcontroller board, to create a functional circuit. The circuit design incorporates various components such as LEDs, resistors, sensors, or any other peripherals relevant to your specific project goals.
In this I done a stimulation model to show the blinking LED whent the code is runned.

The Circuit Connection image is added to it.
